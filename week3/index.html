                    is a moist, soft, creamy, surface-ripened cow's milk cheese. It was first made in the late 18th
                    century in Camembert, Normandy, in northwest France. It is sometimes compared in look and taste to
                    brie cheese, albeit with a slightly lower butterfat content than brie's typical 60% and 75%
                    by weight.</p>

                    or from a mixture of sheep and goat's milk. It is soft, with small or no holes, a compact touch, few
                    cuts, and no skin. Crumbly with a slightly grainy texture, it is formed into large blocks and aged
                    in brine. Its flavor is tangy and salty, ranging from mild to sharp.</p>

                    distributed air pockets. The colour of the cheese varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the
                    inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige.</p>

                    Modena (all of the above being located in the Emilia-Romagna region), as well as in the part of
                    Mantua (Lombardy) which is on the south bank of the River Po.
